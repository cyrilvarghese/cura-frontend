It involves inflammation of small blood vessels with neutrophil infiltration, fibrinoid necrosis, and fragmented neutrophils (leukocytoclasia). The other options are associated with other skin conditions: lymphocytic infiltrate (A) is non-specific, increased mast cells (B) suggest urticaria, and spongiosis (D) is seen in eczema.",

            "explanation": "The key differentiating features are the short duration of the wheals (6-8 hours, resolving within 24 hours) and the absence of systemic symptoms (joint pain, fatigue, bruising) or abnormal lab findings (ANA, complement levels). This presentation is most consistent with chronic idiopathic urticaria (B). Urticarial vasculitis (A) typically involves wheals lasting >24 hours with bruising and systemic symptoms. SLE (C) is less likely without more systemic involvement and abnormal ANA. HUVS (D) would present with low complement levels.",

While oral corticosteroids (C) or other immunosuppressants may be needed for more severe or refractory cases, antihistamines are a reasonable starting point, particularly if systemic symptoms are mild.

In the context of urticarial vasculitis, an elevated ESR supports the diagnosis by indicating systemic inflammation. While other tests might be relevant in a broader workup, ESR directly reflects the inflammatory process driving the vasculitis. Serum creatinine (A) assesses kidney function, LFTs (C) assess liver function, and TSH (D) assesses thyroid function; none of these are as directly relevant to the inflammatory process in urticarial vasculitis.",
