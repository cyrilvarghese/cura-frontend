            "options": {
                "A": "Increase the dose of antihistamines.",

            "image_placeholder_url": null,
            "explanation": "B is correct. Persistent low complement levels despite antihistamine therapy suggest ongoing disease activity and may warrant immunosuppressive treatment such as corticosteroids. A is incorrect as antihistamines primarily target histamine-mediated urticaria, not the underlying vasculitis. C is incorrect as leukotriene receptor antagonists are more commonly used for asthma and allergic rhinitis. D is incorrect as persistent low complement levels can indicate active disease and potential for systemic complications.",
            "concept_modal": {
                "specific": "In urticarial vasculitis, persistently low complement levels indicate ongoing immune complex deposition and inflammation, necessitating escalation of therapy.",

Examine the provided histopathology image (image_placeholder_url: www.example.com/images/urticarial_vasculitis_biopsy.png). Describe the key histopathological findings that support the diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis.",

            "explanation": "Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is the hallmark histological finding in urticarial vasculitis. The presence of neutrophils, fibrinoid necrosis, and red blood cell extravasation indicates damage to the small blood vessels. Immunofluorescence may reveal immune complex deposition, further supporting the diagnosis.",

            "options": null,
            "expected_answer": "Non-pharmacological strategies include physical therapy, low-impact exercise, and heat/cold application. Pharmacological options include NSAIDs (with caution due to potential GI side effects), hydroxychloroquine (monitoring for retinal toxicity), or methotrexate (monitoring for liver and bone marrow toxicity). Opioids should be avoided due to the risk of dependence.",

            "explanation": "A multi-modal approach is essential for managing chronic pain. Non-pharmacological strategies can improve function and reduce reliance on medications.

            "explanation": "B is correct. A positive Anti-dsDNA antibody is highly specific for SLE. While elevated ESR and low C4 can be seen in both conditions, they are not specific for SLE. Mild proteinuria could be seen in both, but with SLE, more significant renal involvement is common. The presence of Anti-dsDNA strongly suggests SLE.",

            "expected_answer": "Advise the patient to avoid prolonged sun exposure, especially during peak hours. Recommend using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days. Suggest wearing protective clothing, such as long sleeves and a wide-brimmed hat. Emphasize the importance of reapplication of sunscreen every two hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Explain that sun exposure can exacerbate skin lesions and systemic symptoms.",

            "image_placeholder_url": null,
            "explanation": "A is correct. Beta-blockers like propranolol can sometimes exacerbate urticaria by blocking beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which normally inhibit mast cell degranulation. This is a less common, but important consideration. B is incorrect because while anxiety can worsen some skin conditions, propranolol's primary effect on urticaria is through beta-receptor blockade. C is incorrect because there is a potential interaction. D is incorrect; propranolol does not directly interfere with antihistamine action.",

            "explanation": "C is correct. A skin biopsy is essential for confirming the diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis by demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A is incorrect as a trial of antihistamines may alleviate symptoms but does not confirm the diagnosis. B is incorrect as allergy testing is not typically indicated in urticarial vasculitis.

            "expected_answer": "Potential second-line agents include dapsone (monitoring for hemolysis and methemoglobinemia), colchicine (monitoring for bone marrow suppression and GI side effects), and hydroxychloroquine (monitoring for retinal toxicity). More potent immunosuppressants like methotrexate or azathioprine may also be considered in severe cases, with appropriate monitoring for liver and bone marrow toxicity.",
