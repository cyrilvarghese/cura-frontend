            "prompt": "A 40-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of swelling involving her lips and tongue, along with itchy, raised welts on her arms and legs that last approximately 36 hours. She also reports mild abdominal cramping. Which of the following features would be MOST suggestive of urticarial vasculitis rather than angioedema?",
            "options": {
                "A": "Presence of lip and tongue swelling.",
                "B": "Itchy, raised welts on the skin.",
                "C": "Welts resolving with residual bruising.",

            "explanation": "While angioedema can present with lip and tongue swelling (A), itchy welts (B), and even abdominal symptoms (D), the presence of residual bruising after the welts resolve is a key differentiating feature of urticarial vasculitis (C).",

                "lateral": "This principle applies to differentiating other vasculitides based on cutaneous findings, such as palpable purpura in Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura."
